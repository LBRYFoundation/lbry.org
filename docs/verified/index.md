# Become a verified creator ![verified](/verified.webp)

A verified creator is a role on the Foundation Discord server that displays separate from other roles. It is a group of creators who have gone through the process described below to verify that they are an active creator on the LBRY platform. The role is largely a vanity role, though it is expected that verified creators help new creators familiarize themselves with LBRY when they can. They can also vote on [Creator of The Week](../governance/creators-council/#creator-of-the-week) (CoTW) and [Creator of The Month](../governance/creators-council/#creator-of-the-month) (CoTM). The group might also be called on for input on decisions as the infrastructure of the Foundation develops.
