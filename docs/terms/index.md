_Last Updated: February 2020_

**PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY. NOTE THAT SECTION 16 CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER, WHICH AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES.**

By clicking to agree to these Terms of Service (**“Terms”**) when running/installing our software, publishing content to LBRY, or by otherwise accessing or using the network [via proxy or direct], mobile applications and online services (collectively, our **“Services”**) of the LBRY Foundation. (**“Organization,” “we,” or “us”**), you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use the Services for any purpose. Please refer to our [Privacy Policy](https://lbry.com/privacypolicy/) for information about how we collect, use and disclose information about you.

You and the Organization agree as follows:

## 1. Overview of LBRY and the Services

**“LBRY”** is a decentralized, consensus-driven protocol that enables the publication and viewing of information, videos, music, data and other materials (**“Content”**).  Content is distributed to LBRY by publishers and is stored in fragmented shards via a distributed network of third-party devices (**“Hosts”**) that utilize LBRY.  LBRY also allows publishers to bid on and reserve names (**“Names”**), which can be used as a unique identifier for Content.  Please consult lbry.tech to learn more about the technical architecture of LBRY.

The Services provide an interface for you to interact with LBRY, including to publish, access, or host Content through LBRY. The LBRY protocol is not owned, operated, or maintained by us. We have no responsibility or liability for LBRY, and the Organization has no ability to control third parties’ use of LBRY. We are not able to delete or remove Content that has been published through LBRY and that may be accessible via the Services.

## 2. Eligibility

You must be at least 13 years of age to access or use our Services. If you are under 18 years of age (or the age of legal majority where you live), you may only access or use our Services under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms. If you are a parent or legal guardian of a user under the age of 18 (or the age of legal majority), you will be fully responsible for the acts or omissions of such user in connection with our Services. If you are accessing or using our Services on behalf of another person or entity, you represent that you are authorized to accept these Terms on that person or entity’s behalf and that the person or entity agrees to be responsible to us if you or the other person or entity violates these Terms.

## 3. Publishing Content

This section applies if you use the Services to publish Content through LBRY.

a) You will make available via the Services a clear and accurate description of Content you publish, and provide the Content in accordance with any descriptions or representations you make available about the Content. You are solely responsible for resolving any disputes with users of your Content, including any chargebacks or refunds, and for any and all injuries, illnesses, damages, claims, liabilities and costs that are caused in whole or in part by you or your Content.  Publishing to a blockchain is permanent.  We cannot remove published content from the blockchain itself, although we can block content accessed via our app or other services on top of the blockchain.

b) LBRY enables publishers to offer Content for sale to other users by setting contract terms within the metadata of the Content. Organization, in its sole discretion, may from time to time impose limits on the ability to sell Content via the Services. Upon the purchase of Content, you and the purchaser of your Content will enter into a separate agreement, pursuant to which that purchaser agrees to pay the specified fees for the Content and you agree to enable access to your Content. You are solely responsible for providing refunds as required to comply with applicable law. You are responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your sale of Content, including, for example, sales, use, value added, and similar taxes. It is also your responsibility to withhold, collect, report and remit the correct taxes to the appropriate tax authorities. The Organization is not responsible for withholding, collecting, reporting, or remitting any sales, use, value added, or similar tax arising from any transaction completed via the Services.

c) The Organization is not a party to and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any users of the Content. We will not be responsible for any loss, misuse, or deletion of Content or any failure of any Content to be encrypted, stored or distributed.. You are solely responsible for your use of the Services, including for configurations that you deem appropriate to determine access to your Content by other users in a manner that meets your expectations. You are solely responsible for backing up any Content. We are not responsible for any user’s access to your Content or any user’s misuse or redistribution of Content.

d) You will not use the Services to reserve a Name that infringes any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other intellectual or proprietary right of any party.

e) We make no representations or warranties regarding the suitability of the Services for the distribution and publishing of any particular types of data. By posting any Content or reserving a Name, you represent and warrant that you have the lawful right, including all necessary intellectual property rights, to distribute and reproduce such Content or use such Name for any purpose, commercial or otherwise. You will provide all notices to, and obtain any consents from third parties as required by applicable law in connection with the distribution and publishing of Content via the Services.

f) You will not use the Services to distribute or publish Content that:

- is unlawful, for example, copyrighted works, underage sexual content, revenge pornography, or any other content illegal under US or state law.
- would constitute, encourage or provide instructions for a criminal offense, violate the rights of any party, or that would otherwise create liability or violate any applicable local, state, national or international law;
- infringes any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other intellectual or proprietary right of any party;
- impersonates any person or entity or otherwise misrepresents your affiliation with a person or entity;
- contains sensitive personal information, including “protected health information,” as defined under HIPAA and its implementing rules; “cardholder data,” as defined by the PCI DSS; “personal information” of a “child” as such terms are defined under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act and its implementing rules; or personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person&#39;s sex life or sexual orientation;
- contains viruses, corrupted data or other harmful, disruptive or destructive files; UNLESS CLEARLY LABELED AS SUCH
- in the sole judgment of the Organization, is objectionable or which restricts or inhibits any other person from using or enjoying LBRY or the Services, or which may expose the Organization or its users to any harm or liability of any type.
- USD equivalent of LBRY Credits (LBC) is determined by 3rd party markets such as Bittrex and Poloniex, not the LBRY Foundation.

## 4. Accessing Content

This section applies if you use the Services to access Content that has been stored through LBRY.

a) In using our Services, you may view or otherwise interact with Content provided by publishers. Your dealings or correspondence with any publisher of Content are solely between you and that publisher. The Organization is not responsible or liable for any damage or loss of any sort caused, or alleged to be caused, by or in connection with any such dealings, including the delivery, quality, safety, legality or any other aspect of any Content that you may access using our Services.

b) In certain instances, your access to Content may be subject to sale terms set forth in the metadata of the Content. Organization, in its sole discretion, may from time to time impose limits on the ability to purchase Content via the Services. Upon your access of any purchased Content, you and the publisher will enter into a separate agreement, pursuant to which you agree to pay the specified fees for the Content and the publisher agrees to make such Content available to you. THE ORGANIZATION DOES NOT HAVE THE POWER OR RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE ANY REFUNDS. You agree to look solely to the publisher to resolve any disputes regarding Content, and that publishers are solely responsible for providing any refunds.

c) All payments for content will be made using LBC and occur on the LBRY blockchain.  Purchaser is buying the right to access content for personal non-commercial use unless content creator provides a license for commercial use or remixing.

## 5. Hosting Content

This section applies to you if you host any Content via LBRY using the Services. The Services allow Hosts to make available storage space (**“Space”**) on the Host’s device for the storage of Content published through LBRY

b) By allowing Space to be utilized to store Content distributed through LBRY, you understand that your device may be impacted due to the additional constraints being placed on it by the processing of Content. In particular, your device may not operate as quickly as it would without making Space available for others to utilize.

c) You will not: (i) reverse engineer any aspect of the Content stored on your device or do anything that might discover the contents or origin of the Content; (ii) attempt to bypass or circumvent measures employed to prevent or limit access to the Content, including attempting to defeat any encryption; or (iii) attempt to interfere with the storage or transmission of Content.

Enforcement of the Content rules set forth in these Terms is solely at our discretion, and subject to our technical capabilities. Failure to enforce such rules in some instances does not constitute a waiver of our right to enforce such rules in other instances. In addition, these rules do not create any private right of action on the part of any third party or any reasonable expectation that the Services will not link to any Content that is prohibited by such rules.

## 7. Limited License; Copyright and Trademark

Our Services and the text, graphics, images, photographs, illustrations, trademarks, trade names, service marks, logos, slogans and other content contained therein (collectively, the **“Organization Marks”**) are owned by Organization and its licensors and are protected under both United States and foreign laws, and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without our or the applicable licensor’s prior written permission.

**The Organization and the other Organization Parties will not be liable to you under any theory of liability—whether based in contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, warranty, or otherwise—for any indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, special or punitive damages or lost profits, even if the Organization or the other Organization Parties have been advised of the possibility of such damages.**

## 16. Dispute Resolution; Arbitration

**Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with the Organization and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.**

### 16.1. Binding Arbitration

Except for any disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands or proceedings (collectively, **“Disputes”**) in which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and the Organization (a) waive your and the Organization’s respective rights to have any and all Disputes arising from or related to these Terms or the Services resolved in a court, and (b) waive your and the Organization’s respective rights to a jury trial. Instead, you and the Organization will arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).

### 16.2. No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions

Any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services is personal to you and the Organization and will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. There will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.

### 16.3. Federal Arbitration Act

These Terms affect interstate commerce and the enforceability of this Section 16 will be both substantively and procedurally governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (the **“FAA”**), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.

### 16.4. Notice; Informal Dispute Resolution

Each party will notify the other party in writing of any arbitrable or small claims Dispute within thirty (30) days of the date it arises, so that the parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute informally. Notice to the Organization will be sent by e-mail to the Organization at hello@lbry.com Notice to you will be by email to the then-current email address in your Account. Your notice must include (a) your name, postal address, email address and telephone number, (b) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (c) the specific relief that you are seeking. If you and the Organization cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date notice is received by the applicable party, then either you or the Organization may, as appropriate and in accordance with this Section 16, commence an arbitration proceeding or, to the extent specifically provided for in Section 17.1, file a claim in court.

### 16.5. Process

Any arbitration will occur in New Castle County, Delaware. Arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (**“JAMS”**), which are hereby incorporated by reference. The state and federal courts located in New Castle County, Delaware will have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award. You may also litigate a Dispute in the small claims court located in the county where you reside if the Dispute meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court.

### 16.6. Authority of Arbitrator

As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the applicable JAMS rules, the arbitrator will have (a) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitrable, and (b) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.

### 16.7. Rules of JAMS

The rules of JAMS and additional information about JAMS are available on the [JAMS website](https://www.jamsadr.com/). By agreeing to be bound by these Terms, you either (a) acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS, or (b) waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.

## 17. Governing Law and Venue

These Terms and your access to and use of the Services will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any Dispute between the parties arising out of or relating to these Terms that is not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims court will be resolved in the state or federal courts of the State of Delaware and the United States, respectively, sitting in New Castle County, Delaware.

## 18. Severability

If any term, clause or provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, then that term, clause or provision will be severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining part of that term, clause or provision, or any other term, clause or provision of these Terms.

## 19. Termination or Suspension

Notwithstanding anything contained in these Terms, we reserve the right, without notice and in our sole discretion, to terminate this agreement or suspend your right to access the Services. You may terminate this agreement without notice by discontinuing use of the Services. All rights and licenses granted to you under these Terms will immediately be revoked upon our termination of the agreement or our suspension of your access to the Services. We make no representations that termination or suspension of the Services will prevent the spread or distribution of published Content through LBRY.

## 20. Amendment

We reserve the right to change these Terms from time to time upon notice to you. If we make changes to these Terms, we will provide notice of such changes by posting the revised Terms to the Services and updating the “Last Updated” date at the top of these Terms. In some cases, we may provide additional notice to you, such as via our Services or to an email address associated with your Account. Your continued use of the Services following our provision of any such notice will confirm your acceptance of the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the modified Terms, you must stop using the Services.

## 21. Survival

The following sections will survive the expiration or termination of these Terms: all defined terms and Sections 12 - 18, 21 and 22.

## 22. Miscellaneous

These Terms constitutes the entire agreement between you and the Organization relating to your access to and use of the Services. We may assign our rights and obligations under these Terms. Under no circumstances may you assign your rights and obligations under these Terms, including in the event of change of control or by operation of law, without our prior written consent. The failure of the Organization to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. We will not be liable for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under these Terms where the delay or failure results from any cause beyond our reasonable control. Except as otherwise provided in herein, the agreement is intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity.
