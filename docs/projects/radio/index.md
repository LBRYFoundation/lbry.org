> We started the first stage of our Radio Foundation with this live link where we will present a curatorship of music channels,
>
> A learning process / implementation of a web radio TV at Lbry / Odysee, with the objective of encouraging and giving visibility to channels and content creators dedicated to Music in its different forms of expression.
>
> In the coming days we will be more and more live, testing here on Lbry / Odysee this channel of ours that is part of the actions planned by the Music Hive community, with the objective of maintaining this programming schedule live seven days a week, 24 hours a day.
>
> We started our grid with partner channels that were interested in seeing their content being disseminated in the programming that is already happening.
