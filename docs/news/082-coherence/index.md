If you thought your Thanksgiving dinner party was about to get weird... you ain't seen nothing yet. This week we bring you: [_Coherence_](https://open.lbry.com/coherence).

An ensemble piece. Science fiction. Horror. _Coherence_ is a stroke of independent film genius that only graces us once in a blue moon. Or in this case, a blue comet.

> _Coherence_ is not just smart science fiction: it's a triumph of crafty independent filmmaking, made with few resources and big ambition... it has that thing we always hope for at the movies: the element of surprise.
